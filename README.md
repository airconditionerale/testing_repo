## Vigenere Cypher
Our code asks the user for a plaintext and a key and outputs the encoded message using the vigenere cypher. To run our code, the user would need to first put in a word in all caps and then a string in all caps as well, and the code will run smoothly. The code consists of two for loops, one to make the plaintext and keystream the same length and then another one to encode the message.
